        "\n",
        "A DNA strand segment typically consists of four unique bases: Adenine (**A**), Thymine (**T**), Guanine (**G**), and Cytosine (**C**). The lab wants to simulate all possible orders in which these bases could mutate over time to identify potentially harmful configurations. Each mutation model considers every possible sequence of a specific length, allowing repeated bases, and the order of bases is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "To maintain biological safety protocols, the lab has a predefined list of harmful configurations (e.g., known oncogenic or disease-causing patterns). Your task is to simulate all possible encodings and **filter out any sequences that match the harmful ones**.\n",
